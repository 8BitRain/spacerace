# Space Race 

**[Play it here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=38734)**

Your private space company SpicoX must successfully deliver 10 rockets to orbit
to win a government contract. Along the way, each rocket will have to dodge its
way through an ever-growing field of [space
debris.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris)

As a private space startup, money is tight. Your company only has enough
funding to lose 3 rockets. Any more and you will run out of money and be forced
out of business.
