# Space Race 

**[Play it here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=38734)**

_Note: this is still a work in progress._

A clone of the 1973 arcade game [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race_(video_game)), except single-player and with some updated graphics.

Reach the top of the screen 10 times to win!

## Controls
Up and down arrow keys - control your spaceship.

## Known Issues
The asteroids are generated randomly when the cart starts up, which sometimes makes it very hard to reach the top of the screen. If you are finding it particularly difficult/impossible to make it past a cluster of asteroids, try resetting the cart to get a new random set of asteroids.
